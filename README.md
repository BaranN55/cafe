Make money and race against the clock to serve hungry raccoon customers at your new job - Bim Borton's!
Cafe chaos is a rapturous game, which the player should give make the orders of the racoon costumers to satisfy them, and if passing all the three levels, thay will win a consert ticket (not for REAL). We built this project for JPEG, an overnight female and non-binary focused game jam at Carleton University. We were given a picture of racoons in Tim Hortons and we had to build a game based on the picture. Our idea was that using HTML and a little bit of JS to build a game that looks like overcooked but in our cute racoon version.
Throught this projet, we most struggled with debugging and positioning different elements in the screen but as we went through codes over and over and with some research, we managed to build this masterpiece. We also struggled a lot with hackatime during the beginning of the jam... Coordination was an issue between us since art had to be done quick to be put into the game while the coding side needed to wait for the art to be done (in retrospect, we could've used placeholders so as not to rush...)
We learned a lot about using HTML and JS to make games - it was a first for the both of us!
We hope you enjoy playing it!
